# ETL Weather Pipeline with Apache Airflow

## Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using **Apache Airflow** to process weather data. The pipeline extracts real-time weather data from an API, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a database for further analysis or reporting.

## Features

- **Automated ETL Workflow**: Orchestrated using Apache Airflow.
- **Weather Data Extraction**: Fetches data from a weather API.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and formats the raw data.
- **Data Loading**: Stores the transformed data into a database.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable for additional transformations or data sources.

# Technologies Used

- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration tool to manage ETL tasks.
- **Python**: Programming language for writing ETL logic.
- **Weather API**: (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or similar) for fetching weather data.
- **Database**: For storing processed data (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- **Libraries**: `requests`, `pandas`, etc.
